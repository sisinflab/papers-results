# papers-results

This section will contain a set of extended results for which there is no room on research papers. Once the work is published, the related README will be completed to provide:
1. Bibtex of the related paper
2. PDF of the paper
3. Implementation of the method
4. Link to the used Datasets 
5. Parameters of the method and competing algorithms
6. Extended results of Experimental Evaluation

The idea here is to provide the practitioners and researches a freely available set of results, together with datasets and parameters, to ease the process of next comparisons.
